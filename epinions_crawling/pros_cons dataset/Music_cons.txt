<cons>Some of the lyrics are written a bit haphazardly.</cons>
<name>Yield by Pearl Jam (CD, Feb-1998, Epic (USA))</name>

<cons>NONE</cons>
<cons>Not as good as the original.</cons>
<cons>It's saying something when a group can rock harder than Slayer.</cons>

<cons>...most of the album is dull radio-friendly rock, with nothing truly spectacular</cons>
<cons>hardly original, doesn't challenge himself in spots, very Nickelback like too often</cons>
<name>Rubber Soul</name>
<cons>Casing is easily breakable, CD scratches easily, can split in headphones while listening</cons>

<name>Youth</name>
<cons>Nasal vocals arean acquired taste. Some amateurish lyrics. Reggae purists may complain about overproduction.</cons>
<name>Lifesong</name>
<cons>It's all boring electric stadium rock and inspo ballads. Oh, and can you say "didactic"?</cons>

<name>Meteora</name>
<cons>Not all star-caliber, enhancements may not work for you.</cons>

<name>Minutes to Midnight [PA] [Digipak] by Linkin Park (CD, May-2007, Warner Bros.)</name>
<cons>More adjustments to the band's former rap/rock sound that show pure idiocy.</cons>
<cons>Mike is absent far too often, I wish Linkin Park hadn't added the profanity!</cons>
<name>Ten</name>
<cons>I'm sick of people whining about how Pearl Jam should sound like this again.</cons>
<cons>terribly dark, too generic</cons>

<cons>Weak harmonizing vocals; no strong vocal lead; sound like a rock band at times.</cons>
<cons>Very cheesy, tries too hard, cynically commercial</cons>
<cons>bombastic production drowns everything out, feels like a radio record, bland</cons>
<cons>tears, tears, and more tears, not really a con but it sucks crying</cons>
<cons>On other reviews I readthey think the CD does not have enough variety.</cons>
<name>Anthology</name>
<cons>Some might consider it too syrupy</cons>
<cons>Not a one.</cons>

<name>Axis: Bold as Love [Remaster] by Jimi Hendrix/The Jimi Hendrix Experience (CD, Apr-1997, Universal Distribution)</name>
<cons><i>Spanish Castle Magic</i></cons>
